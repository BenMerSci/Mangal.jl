 visitant to the salt marshes around San Francisco Bay. Between four and te

llets, 75 per cent were mammals, 20 per cent birds, and 5 per cent insects.
 Mammals were responsible for about 90 per cent of the mass consumed, Micro
tus and Rattus being the most important kinds. The relationship of Short-ea
