# Mangal

This manual describes the functionalities of the `Mangal.jl` package, to query
data from species interaction networks. This package is a wrapper around the
*new* API for the mangal ecological interactions database. It uses [Julia
1.0][jl] to provide a programmatic interface to *read* the data. Development of
this package and the underlying database was funded by the [Canadian Foundation
for Innovation][cfi].
