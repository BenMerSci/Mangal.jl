# Integration with `EcologicalNetworks.jl`

The **Mangal** package is integrated with **EcologicalNetworks** for analysis.

```julia
using Mangal
using EcologicalNetworks
```

## A simple example

In this simple example, we will look at a food web from 1956, retrieve it from
the Mangal database, then convert it into a usable object:

```julia
db_version = network("johnston_1956_19560101_947")
```

The conversion to the network is done using the `convert` method, which by
default will return a `UnipartiteNetwork`, where species are the `MangalNode` of
the original network:

```julia
N = convert(UnipartiteNetwork, db_version)
```

We can check that the type of the network is correct:

```julia
eltype(N)
```

```julia
count(MangalInteraction, db_version) == links(N)
```

```julia
count(MangalNode, db_version) == richness(N)
```
